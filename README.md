PROJECT NAME: Student Grade Management System

DESCRIPTION:
The Student Grade Management System is a Python-based command-line application
that stores student details, calculates grades based on marks, and saves records.


SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE

1. REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
- The system should store student names and marks.
- The system must automatically calculate grades.
- Data should persist even after program termination.

2. PLANNING
- Python selected for ease of implementation.
- JSON file used for lightweight data storage.
- Menu-driven interface chosen for simplicity.

3. DESIGN
- Student data structure:
  • Name
  • Marks
  • Grade
- Modular functions created for:
  • Adding students
  • Viewing records
  • Calculating grades

4. DEVELOPMENT
- Python modules used:
  • json
  • os
- Functions and loops implemented to handle user interaction.

5. TESTING
- Tested adding valid and invalid student data.
- Verified grade calculation logic.
- Checked data persistence after restarting the application.

6. DEPLOYMENT
- Application runs locally using:
  python student_grade_system.py
- No external dependencies required.

7. MAINTENANCE
- Future enhancements:
  • Update or delete student records
  • Export results to CSV
  • Add graphical interface
